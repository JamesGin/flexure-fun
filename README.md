# flexure-fun
Flexures are essentially springs that form the basis of compliant mechanisms. 
That's where movement comes from the deflection of material, rather than from joints
like pivots, or slides. Flexures have many design, and manufacturing benefits. They
are also easy to make with 3D printers and laser cutters, which makes them easy to 
incorporate into various personal projects. This repository is a collection of 
some of the flexures that I have used in my own projects, or just really like.

Enjoy!
